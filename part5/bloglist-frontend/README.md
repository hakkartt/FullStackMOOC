# Bloglist app
This is an app to create blog entries and delete them. Additionally one can give likes to other blogs.

## NB:
Please note that if you want to remove blogs from the list, you need to be logged in with a user that created the blog entry in the first place. If the remove button disappears after clicking the "like" button or doesn't appear immedeately after creating a new log entry, please refresh the page. This is is a known bug in the implementation and isn't fixed since this is only a practice application.
